Using ZSH on iTerm with [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme

### ZSH and VIM
Files have basic config stuff nothing too fancy

### Karabiner
Remapped the 'x' key to act as a hyper key that controls Spotify through an [Alfred workflow](https://alfred-spotify-mini-player.com/). Tutorial to configure more keys like this can be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6). 

<sub>NOTE: It's very easy to trigger these keys accidentaly while typing. I've looked but haven't really found a work around for this behavior. If I had, I would definitely have more of these set up.</sub>

Some of the stuff I can do with this 'x' key
* Start playing a specified playlist by pressing x + j
* Skip to next song/skip to previous song by pressing x + c and x + z
* Browse my playlists by pressing x + p (activates Spotify Alfred workflow)
* Search Spotify by pressing x + f (activates Spotify Alfred workflow)
* etc...

### BetterTouchTool
Configured trackpack actions that let me:
* Open, close, and navigate Firefox and Finder tabs
* Control volume, Spotify pauseplay, and Spotify next track and previous track
